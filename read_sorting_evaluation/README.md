## EAGLE-RC

Here you can find the scripts to run and evaluate EAGLE-RC on all the datasets used via ARPEGGIO. This means that you will find a metadata and a config file for each dataset.

## Genome concatenation

Since this is a common ad hoc approach, you will find custom scripts to run the analyses. Please keep in mind that the **version of all tools used are the same one as in ARPEGGIO**.
